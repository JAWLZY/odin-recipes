        <h2>Description</h2>
            It’s time homemade pudding gets the attention it deserves. Pudding has to be the most underrated dessert <em>ever</em>. It’s not as fancy or decadent as a pot de crème, mousse, or crème brûlée. It’s comforting, nostalgic, and uncomplicated, and that’s what we love about it!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One third cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>One eighth teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Two and one fourth cups whole milk</li>
            <li>Two large egg yolks</li>
            <li>One tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>One and a half teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan whisk together sugar, cornstarch, salt, milk, and egg yolks. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking <em>occasionally</em> (every minute or two), until the mixture is bubbling all throughout (this took 7-8 minutes for mine).<br>Once bubbling, continue cooking for one to two additional minutes, whisking once or twice, but not too vigorously (this can break down the binding properties). At this point the pudding should be thickened but still pourable, it will thicken more as it cools. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and whisk in butter and vanilla extract.<br><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> To remove lumps, place a fine mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl. Pour the mixture through the strainer and into the bowl. Skip this step if you don't notice any lumps in your pudding.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pudding into a large bowl or into individual serving bowls. Cool until it is lukewarm, then cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for several hours or until chilled.</li>
        </ol>
