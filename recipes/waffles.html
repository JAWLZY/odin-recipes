        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties. Waffles <em>may</em> be commercially cooked, frozen, and reheated, but we are going to show you how to make them fresh. </p>
